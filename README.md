### About me

ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, my name is Henry! Iâ€™m in my 4th and final year at Northeastern University. I am in my plus one masters year in Computer Science. I love the intersection of math and cs, specifically in automata theory, np-completeness, and cool data structures. Iâ€™m currently reading about some math history! ðŸ“–

More of my projects can be seen on my <a href="http://henrybarthelemy.com/"> website's projects page </a>
