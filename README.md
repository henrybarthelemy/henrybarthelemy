### About me

ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, my name is Henry! Iâ€™m a second year Computer Science and Mathematics student at Northeastern University. I love the intersection of math and cs, specifically in automata theory, np-completness, and cool data structures. Iâ€™m currently learning some new languages, including Django for web apps and Lean for theorem proving.

Feel free to reach out to me on
