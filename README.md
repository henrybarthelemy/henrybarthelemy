### About me

👋 Hi there, my name is Henry! I’m a second year Computer Science and Mathematics student at Northeastern University. I love the intersection of math and cs, specifically in automata theory, np-completeness, and cool data structures. I’m currently learning some new languages, including Django for web apps and Lean for theorem proving.

More of my projects can be seen on my <a href="http://henrybarthelemy.github.io/projects.html"> website's projects page </a>

Feel free to reach out to me on
